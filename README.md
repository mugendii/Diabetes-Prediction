# Diabetes-Prediction
In Assignments I & II you will go through the entire journey of a small data science project. 
* In Part I, you will explore the data and preprocess it.
* In Part II, you will apply supervised machine learning models on the same dataset, evaluate its perofrmance, and identify the best models.

In this assignment (Part I), you will analyze the Pima-Indians-Diabetes-Data using Python’s Pandas. The dataset can be downloaded from kaggle. This dataset consists of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. 

The columns of this dataset are as follows:

1. Pregnancies — Number of times pregnant
2. GlucosePlasma — glucose concentration 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
3. Blood Pressure — Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. SkinThickness — Triceps skin-fold thickness (mm)
5. Insulin — Two hours of serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. BMI — Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)²)
7. Diabetes Pedigree Function — Diabetes pedigree function
8. Age — Age in years
9. Outcome — Class variable (indicates whether the patient is diabetic or not)
